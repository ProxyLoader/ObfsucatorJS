# ObfuscatorJS

ObfuscatorJS is a powerful JavaScript obfuscation tool that encrypts your JavaScript files and stores the encrypted versions in a compressed archive. This is an excellent solution for protecting your code from unauthorized access and ensuring the security of your web applications.

## Getting Started

To use ObfuscatorJS, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```npm install```
2. Obfuscate your JavaScript files by running the following command:
```node index.js ./examplePath```
Replace `./examplePath` with the path to the directory containing the JavaScript files you want to obfuscate.

This command will obfuscate all the JavaScript code in the specified directory and store the encrypted versions in a compressed archive.

That's it! Your JavaScript files are now securely obfuscated and ready for deployment.
